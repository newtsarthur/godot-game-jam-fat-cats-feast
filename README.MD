# Sprout Shadow

This game was created specifically for the **[Gamedev.js Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2025)**, which took place from April 13 to April 26, 2025.  
The theme of the jam was **“Balance”**, and *Sprout Shadow* was developed from scratch during that period using the **Godot Engine**, focusing on balance-based mechanics and puzzle-solving.  
All the game's source code is open source and available in this repository.
