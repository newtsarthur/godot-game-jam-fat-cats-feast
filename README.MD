# Sprout Shadow

This game was created specifically for the **[Gamedev.js Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2025)**, which took place from April 13 to April 26, 2025.  
The theme of the jam was **“Balance”**, and *Sprout Shadow* was developed from scratch during that period using the **Godot Engine**, focusing on balance-based mechanics and puzzle-solving.  
All the game's source code is open source and available in this repository.

## Engine

This game was built using Godot Engine 4.4.1.

## Web Build (HTML5)

The **HTML5 executable** of the game is located in the [`/build`](./build) folder.

If you'd like to run the game locally in your browser:

### Run locally with Python (simple server)

```bash
cd build
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open your browser and go to:

> Make sure `index.html` is in the `/build` folder and your browser supports WebGL and WebAssembly.
